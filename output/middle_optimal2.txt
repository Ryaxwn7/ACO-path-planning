All routes before conflict resolution: [[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6)], [(0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1)], [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 6)], [(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3)]]

Resolving conflicts...
Conflict type: vertex, loc:  (4, 4)
添加新约束: CBSConstraint(agent=1, loc=(4, 4), timestep=4)
agent:  1 timestep:  4 loc:  (4, 4) wait
Conflict type: vertex, loc:  (4, 4)
添加新约束: CBSConstraint(agent=2, loc=(4, 4), timestep=4)
agent:  2 timestep:  4 loc:  (4, 4) wait
Solution is conflict-free
